# Movie-Gender-Ratio-Analysis
This project intends to investigate the proportion of speech among genders in different films. This project is inspired by the work of Amber Thomas (@ProQuestionAsker: https://github.com/ProQuestionAsker/2016MovieDialogue).  To do this, I am using R and the package rvest to scrape movie script, which are accessible on the site https://imsdb.com.
